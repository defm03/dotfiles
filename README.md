# .dotfiles

Dotfiles from my /home directory. I'm using #!. [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh)
and [yadr](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) are included - really comfortable repo.
.config contains basic configuration for crushbang, slightly modified - gtkrc, conky,
openbox, terminator, geany syntax colors etc. Also in main dir you can find .git files.
At last: I use right now yadr .vim, but I leave backup of an older config. Feel free
to use, if you want to - I send this mostly for myself.
